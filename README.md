# Assignment Overview
This assignment is designed to provide practice with various data structures and their applications, as well as reinforce programming concepts through the implementation of a small caterpillar game.

## Learning Objectives
* Practice implementing different data structures, including linked lists, stacks, and queues.
* Understand how to parse encoded strings and manipulate directional information.
* Develop a basic game using implemented data structures, involving movement, collision detection, and game state management.

## Parts of the Assignment

### Part I: Data Structures
* Implement classes for linked lists, stacks, and queues, along with methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements.

### Part II: Information Parsing with Stacks
* Create a class to parse encoded strings containing directional information, decoding them into sequences of directional movements.

### Part III: Caterpillar Game
* Develop a small game where a caterpillar navigates a 2D map to consume food items.
* Implement classes for game world, caterpillar, food positions, and game state management.

# Conclusion
This assignment provides an opportunity to strengthen programming skills through practical implementation of data structures and game development concepts.
